I sit at the computer a lot, trying to solve technical problems with help of various software (R, python, SQL, QGIS and if I have to, ArcGIS). This might not sound very interesting but those fortunate enough to be in the same position will know: this type of work is extremely satisfying. 

Sometimes I find a solution that I like so much that I want to document it, so I can use it again in the future. Sometimes I think of an interesting problem to solve, which has nothing to do with my job. For these very cases I've started writing this blog. As you see, this is mainly for myself, but if others can profit from it, all the better. But I don't have any misconception: in the vastness if the internet, my musings will mostly be a conversation with myself.
